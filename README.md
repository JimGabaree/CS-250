Interpreting a user’s needs is an imperative trait for a programmer. In the field of coding communication with a client is key and one of the avenues to ensure you are on the same page is user stories. This allows the user to supply their feedback on what’s already implemented. Their feedback in turn can be utilized to ensure your program is updated to meet the needs of the user. By keeping the user in mind your client will also benefit due to their clients being happy with the program they are using which in turn creates potential future business for your organization. In my future projects I would like to spend more time gathering requirements. Currently I jump into a project and I feel if I slowed down a tad and obtained more documentation I would benefit in the long run when I take on larger projects. Being a good team member in the world of agile or a scrum team is mastering communication skills. It is also creating readable code that is properly annotated so another coder can easily pickup where you left off or assist you on your working project.
